1) Open index.html in a browser.
2) If you are printing / saving to PDF, enable "Background graphics" for best visual fidelity.
3) Source documents are in /docs and linked from the Appendix section.

This version embeds all styling, charts, and header graphics directly into index.html so it renders correctly even if opened from a ZIP preview.
